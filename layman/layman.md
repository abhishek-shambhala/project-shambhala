**If you are a layman, start here!**  

Instead of loosely using word layman, lets make a good defination of who is layman on this landscape and lets see if you are a layman. 

# Who is a layman here?  
This is a good question to start with. Who is layman, and are you layman on this landscape ? Ask yourself, do you understand artificial intelligence? If not then does this make you  a layman ? If we say that someone who does not understands artificial intelligence is a layman, then I guess everyone is a layman, as this technology is under development. So clearly this is not a good way to define a layman of this field.  

Then who can be a layman ? Before we go to layman, lets look at lemons. Someone who thinks he or she understands Artificial Intelligence is a sour lemon here for sure, because they are under illusion of knowing. They believe they know and understands Artificial Intelligence. So avoid this illusion, be anyone here but not lemon, as Artificial intelligence is a sweet shop of bright future.
