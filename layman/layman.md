**If you are a layman, start here!**  
**Status:** Under development

Instead of loosely using word layman, lets make a good defination of who is layman on this landscape and lets see if you are a layman. 

# Who is a layman here?  
This is a good question to start with. Who is layman, and are you a layman on this landscape ? Ask yourself, do you understand artificial intelligence? If not then does this make you a layman ? If we define a layman as someone who doesn’t understand AI, then by that logic, almost everyone would be a layman — considering that AI is still evolving and under development. So, clearly, this isn’t an effective way to define a layman in the field of AI.

Then who can be a layman ? Before we go to layman, lets look at lemons. Someone who thinks he or she understands Artificial Intelligence is a sour lemon here for sure, because they are under illusion of knowing. They believe they know and understands Artificial Intelligence. So avoid this illusion, be anyone here but not lemon, as Artificial intelligence is a sweet shop of bright future.

Now that we know who lemons are, lets focus on layman. Who is layman ? Layman is anyone and everyone who takes word "Artificial Intelligence" too seriously. One of the tragedies of life is everyone names everything a bit wrong, it makes it hard to understand what the subject is actually about to everyone. Problem with word artificial intelligence is it uses a word (intelligence) which we dont completely understand. 

The question that you need to ask yourself is from where are you borrowing the notion of artifical intelligence? Is it from media, marketing or anecdote? If it is from any of these, then you need to realize that you have to undo it, atleats when you are reading this material. I am writing this material from technical perspective, from lens of creator. And this work is research oriented, so when we look at artificial intelligence we need to be absolutely crystal clear about our vision and objective. What is it that we want to achieve here? 

The world and notion of information changed, or evolved when we invented computers, and it gave us new way to see, observer and express the world that we live in. In such a place it will be nicer if we can have computers imitate intelligence. The quest of artificial intelligence is of imitation of intelligence. Here we are not replicating intelligence or creating it artificially, as maybe the word will suggest but we are imitating it, there is a very subtule difference. I want you to keep this in your mind. Going forward you will understand why this difference matters. 

Now it may seem a very small thing, but going forward this will make big diffeence. 

Now with this I have saved you from land of imposters, a land which is made with misconception around this technology. Now we can hopefully go towards the real path of artificial intelligence, this is misfortunes of life, I have to use this name artificial intelligence as a place holder to say act of imitating intelligence with machines, as this name is populary accepted.
