**If you are a layman, start here!**  
**Status:** Under development

Instead of loosely using word layman, lets make a good defination of who is layman on this landscape and lets see if you are a layman. 

# Who is a layman here?  
This is a good question to start with. Who is layman, and are you layman on this landscape ? Ask yourself, do you understand artificial intelligence? If not then does this make you  a layman ? If we say that someone who does not understands artificial intelligence is a layman, then I guess everyone is a layman, as this technology is under development. So clearly this is not a good way to define a layman of this field.  

Then who can be a layman ? Before we go to layman, lets look at lemons. Someone who thinks he or she understands Artificial Intelligence is a sour lemon here for sure, because they are under illusion of knowing. They believe they know and understands Artificial Intelligence. So avoid this illusion, be anyone here but not lemon, as Artificial intelligence is a sweet shop of bright future. 

Now that we know who lemons are, lets focus on layman. Who is layman ? Layman is anyone and everyone who takes word "Artificial Intelligence" too seriously. One of the tragedies of life is everyone names everything a bit wrong, it makes it hard to understand what the subject is about to everyone. Problem with word artificial intelligence is it uses a word (intelligence) which we dont completely understand. 

The question that you need to ask yourself is from where are you borrowing the notion of artifical intelligence? Is it from media, marketing or anecdote? If it is from any of these, then you need to realize that you have to undo it, atleats when you are reading this material. I am writing this material from technical perspective, from lens of creator. 




# TMP (confused if to write more on this)
THis is the problem that I find with this discourse. I think, more and more people need to talk about artificial intelligence, we need more views and commentry on this, but while doing so people also need to get educated on this subject, and to get educated you have to have the lense of an engineer. And to get that, you dont need to do engineering, I will write about what you need
