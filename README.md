# Project Shambhala 🧠

**Exploring and Teaching AI from First Principles — Intuitively, Deeply, Practically.**

---

## 🧭 What is This?

Project Shambhala is an independent, evolving journey to teach and document Artificial Intelligence — from intuition to deep math and real-world implementation.

It starts from the ground up:
- No background required
- From computers and programming
- Through math, logic, learning, and intelligence
- To cutting-edge AI

---

## 🧠 How It’s Taught

- Start with intuition  
- Build deep understanding  
- Connect theory to practice  
- Make everything clear, layered, and rigorous

---

## 📂 What to Expect

This repository will grow to include:
- Lessons in plain language
- Deep dives into math and theory
- Code demos and walkthroughs
- AI history and context
- Clean, cited documentation

---

## 🚧 Status

In progress. Content will be added regularly.  
Follow along, contribute, or use freely.
